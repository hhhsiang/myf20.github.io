  title={A Single-Inductor Multi-Output Converter with Multi-Vector Current Control in Power-saving Driving Skill of Electronic Paper Displays (EPDs)},
  author={Huang, M.-H. and Lee, Y.-H. and Fan, M.-Y. and Chen, K.-H.},

  abstract={Electronic paper display (EPD) shows the trend of state-of-the-art display technique. It not only holds image/text without consuming energy but also presents thin and flexibility like ordinary paper. Single-inductor multi-output (SIMO) converter, with innovative multi-vector current-control methodology, precisely tracks and quantifies the actual demanded-energy and addresses excessive-energy for power-efficient and space-minimized requirements of EPDs. The testing chip occupies 0.45 mm2 in 0.25 μm CMOS technology and achieves the power conversion efficiency larger than 85 % at the order of 0.5 m W output power.},

  abstract={Energy harvesting techniques have been developed more than a decade and received much attention in realizing long-term energy autonomous microsystems. Many converter topologies and circuit techniques have been reported to effectively convert the harvested energy to usable outputs. In this paper, major green energy sources as well as the equivalent circuits are reviewed. In addition, maximum power point tracking (MPPT) technique and power conversion topologies are also included.},

  title={A Single-Inductor Bipolar-Output Converter with 5mV Positive Voltage Ripple for Active Matrix OLED},
  author={Chen, W.-C. and Chiu, C.-C. and Hsieh, C.-Y. and Huang, T.-C. and Lee, Y.-H. and Yang, Y.-Y. and Shih, C.-J. and Fan, M.-Y. and Chen, K.-H.},

  abstract={This paper proposed a single inductor bipolar outputs (SIBO) switching converter for the active matrix Organic Light-Emitting Diode (AMOLED). The negative voltage is generated by the inverting buck-boost converter, which is regulated by the high signal-to-noise ratio comparator. Moreover, the boost converter is utilized to provide the positive output voltage. The proposed switching converter uses the switch sequential to reduce the positive voltage ripple to about 5 mV with the proportional-integral (PI) compensator to guarantee good line and load-regulation. Simulation results show the positive output voltage is regulated to 5 V and the negative output voltage is -7 V for driving the AMOLED. When the load current is 25 mA and the ESR is 30 mΩ, the output voltage ripples are equal to 5 mV and 11 mV for positive and negative voltages, respectively. Besides, the load and line regulations of positive output voltage are 0.24 mV/mA and 5 mV/V, respectively. The maximum efficiency is 88.5% when the input voltage is 4.5 V and the load current is 50 mA.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
